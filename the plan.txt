the plan

use spacial hash maps for nearching for the neighbors within a given radius

training can use spacial culster density SCD coined by me to determin the how a partial dervavtive can have respect to each cluster allowing for fine tuning 

currently working on:
-ensureing proper pointers. cascade grows past 100k with 100k neurons. -- done
-speed improvements --done use optimizing compiler.
-learning: using gradient decent and back propogation for each inputs "path" and only calculating the hit neurons and how they effect that forward propagation. also potentially a general move of the unused neurons to move twords the origin. 
-optimize only use cluster distance and depricate activation distance

include Bias


No negative for vector movement?
